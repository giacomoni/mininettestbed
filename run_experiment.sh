# Run two competing flows in a Dumbel topology with 100Mbps and varying RTT. Repeat the experiment for three different buffer sizes. 
# The two flows should co-exist long enough to allow cubic to converge. We let the coexist for 1000x RTTs. The first flow lives for 500 RTTs, second flow enters
#  and coexist with first flow for 1000 RTTs
